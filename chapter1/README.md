Solutions to Chapter 1
======================

Chapter 1 deals with arrays and strings.
In real life, solving many of the problems in this chapter is trivial using Python's built-in [list](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists) and [string](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods) class.
I deliberately avoided using these since they would take the fun out of the exercise.
