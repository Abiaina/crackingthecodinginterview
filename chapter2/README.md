Solutions to Chapter 2
======================

The focus of this chapter is [linked lists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list).
The problems are mostly self-contained, with the exception of the implementation of the linked list.
More specifically, sll.py contains a trivial implementation of a singly linked list, which attempts to balance simplicity, brevity, and minimal code duplications in the solutions.
